If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    I would calculate average values of energy, valence and danceability of the 100 songs. Then, I would consider
a 3-dimensional space where the dimensions are our variables. Based on the three averages, the user is put
somewhere in this space. Then I could define auras, for example with a cluster analysis, or simply manually
deciding avg values for each aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    This could not be representative of the listener because it's not so easy to understand emotions just though
these parameters. An optimal way could be making text mining on songs lyrics to extract and add a new variable
related to the song emotion to use it in the classification.
