# CS50x Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science course assignments. It covers various topics in computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and web development.


### Technologies Used (by now)
- C


### Problem Sets

#### Problem Set 1: First Codes in C
- /world: printed "Hello World" and "Hello [name]".
- /mario: created a Mario-like pyramid.
- /credit: implemented credit card validation using the Luhn algorithm.

#### Problem Set 2: Arrays and Functions
- /scrabble: calculated points in Scrabble using arrays and loops.
- /readability: evaluated reading grades of texts (Flesch-Kincaid score) using functions.
- /substitution: encrypted a message using a substitution cipher with an alphabetic key given by user.

#### Problem Set 3: Algorithms
- /sort: recognised three sorting algorithms based on their running times.
- /plurality: completed a program to manage a vote with plurality system.
- /runoff: completed a program that uses ranked-choice voting system to handle ties.

#### Problem Set 4: Memory
- /volume: copied an audio file (.WAV) modifying its volume by a factor given by user.
- /filter-more: applied filters to bitmap images: grayscale, reflect, blur and edges (I chose this difficult version because edges filter is related to AI).
- /recover: recover JPEGs files from the forensic image of a memory card.
