# CS50x Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science course assignments. It covers various topics in computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and web development.


### Technologies Used (by now)
- C (problem sets 1 to 5)
- Python (problem set 6)
- SQL (problem set 7)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (problem set 8)


### Problem Sets

#### Problem Set 1: First Codes in C
- /world: printed "Hello World" and "Hello [name]".
- /mario: created a Mario-like pyramid.
- /credit: implemented credit card validation using the Luhn algorithm.

#### Problem Set 2: Arrays and Functions
- /scrabble: calculated points in Scrabble using arrays and loops.
- /readability: evaluated reading grades of texts (Flesch-Kincaid score) using functions.
- /substitution: encrypted a message using a substitution cipher with an alphabetic key given by user.

#### Problem Set 3: Algorithms
- /sort: recognised three sorting algorithms based on their running times.
- /plurality: completed a program to manage a vote with plurality system.
- /runoff: completed a program that uses ranked-choice voting system to handle ties.

#### Problem Set 4: Memory
- /volume: copied an audio file (.WAV) modifying its volume by a factor given by user.
- /filter-more: applied filters to bitmap images: grayscale, reflect, blur and edges (I chose this difficult version because edges filter is related to AI).
- /recover: recover JPEGs files from the forensic image of a memory card.

#### Problem Set 5: Data Structures
- /inheritance: completed a program that assignes alleles to a person based on previous generations.
- /speller: implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

#### Problem Set 6: Python
- /sentimental-folders: implemented some of the previous problems in Python.
- /dna: implemented a program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs.

#### Problem Set 7: SQL
- /songs: wrote simple queries for gathering info about spotify top 100 songs table.
- /movies: wrote queries for gathering info about films and actors from IMDb database.
- /fiftyville: searched a large database to find out the culprit of a theft, where they escaped and who helped them.

#### Problem Set 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- /trivia: made a quiz game page interactive with javascript.
- /homepage: created a little and simple website about reading with an interactive test.
