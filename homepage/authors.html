                    <h4>Fëdor Dostoevsky</h4>
                    <p>Fëdor Dostoevskij (1821–1881) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist, and philosopher.
                        He is considered one of the greatest writers in world literature. Born in Moscow, Dostoevsky faced
                        numerous hardships throughout his life, including a death sentence (which was later commuted to exile
                        in Siberia) and a lifelong struggle with epilepsy and gambling addiction. His works are famous for
                        their deep exploration of psychology, morality, and existentialism. Themes of suffering, the nature of
                        good and evil, and the complexities of human freedom are central to his novels. Some of his most renowned
                        works include Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and The Idiot, which delve into the moral
                        and spiritual struggles of the human soul.</p>

                        story collections, and 17 plays. She is often called the "Queen of Crime" for her contribution to the

                        iconic in the world of crime fiction. Her novels, with intricate plots and surprising twists, have captivated

                        continues to influence writers and filmmakers today.</p>

                    <h4>Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
                    <p>Yuval Noah Harari is an Israeli historian, professor, and author, best known for his thought-provoking
                        books that tackle large-scale questions about humanity’s past, present, and future. Born in 1976 in
                        Haifa, Israel, Harari earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of Oxford and specializes in
                        world history, macro-historical processes, and the human condition. He gained international fame with
                        his book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which explores the history of Homo sapiens from the
                        Stone Age to modern times, examining how we became the dominant species on Earth. His subsequent works,
                        including Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, delve into
                        the future of humanity in the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology. Harari's books challenge
                            readers to reflect on the impact of technology and human choices on the future of society and the planet.</p>
